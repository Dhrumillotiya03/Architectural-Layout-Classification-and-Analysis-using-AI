## Design Family Identification:
 Goal: Group designs by shape for better standardization.  
 Methods: Use clustering and deep learning to categorize similar designs.
 
## Layout Complexity Classification:
 Goal: Define complexity levels for better understanding.  
 Plan: Analyze designs and use machine learning to classify complexity.
 
## Layout Retrieval for Faster Design:
 Goal: Quickly find past designs based on parameters.  
 Solution: Develop a system to predict suitable design families.
